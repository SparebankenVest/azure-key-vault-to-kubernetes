Akv2k8s consist of three main components to integrate with Azure Key Vault:

* a Custom Resource Definition called `AzureKeyVaultSecret`
* Controller
* Env Injector

## The AzureKeyVaultSecret CRD

The `AzureKeyVaultSecret` Custom Resource Definition (CRD) contains metadata used by the Controller and Env Injector to access objects in Azure Key Vault. For each secret, certificate or key in AzureKeyVault you want to make available in Kubernetes, you create a `AzureKeyVaultSecret` and provide the following information:

* The Kubernetes namespace where the Azure Key Vault secret should be available
* The name of the Azure Key Vault
* The name, type and version (optional) of the Azure Key Vault object
* Optionally which Kubernetes `Secret` name and data-key to create 

An example `AzureKeyVaultSecret` looks like this:

```yaml
# secret-sync.yaml

apiVersion: spv.no/v1alpha1
kind: AzureKeyVaultSecret
metadata:
  name: secret-sync 
  namespace: akv-test
spec:
  vault:
    name: akv2k8s-test # name of key vault
    object:
      name: my-secret # name of the akv object
      type: secret # akv object type
  output: # optional - only used to sync to a kubernetes secret
    secret: 
      name: my-secret-from-akv # kubernetes secret name
      dataKey: secret-value # key to store object value in kubernetes secret
```

## The Controller

The Controller is responsible for syncing Azure Key Vault objects into Kubernetes `Secret`'s, for all `AzureKeyVaultSecret`'s having `spec.output.secret` defined (like in the example above).

Periodically the Controller will poll Azure Key Vault for version changes of the secret and apply any changes to the Kubernetes `Secret`.

> **Note-1: Pods in Kubernetes currently do not get notifications when Secret resources change, and Pods will have to be re-created or use something like the Wave controller (https://github.com/pusher/wave) to get the changes**

> **Note-2: By default the Controller auto sync secrets every 10 minutes (configurable) and depending on how many secrets are synchronized can cause extra usage costs of Azure Key Vault.**

## The Env Injector

The Env Injector is a bit more complex than the Controller and consists of:

* a Mutating Admission Webhook (see [Kubernetes docs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/admission-controllers/#mutatingadmissionwebhook))
* a Docker image (spvest/azure-keyvault-env) containing the `azure-keyvault-env` executable

Below is an outline of the steps that gets executed when a Pod is scheduled to start, in a namespace enabled for Env-Injector.

### The Mutating Admission Webhook triggers

The Env Injector webhook gets triggered just before every Pod gets created and inspects the Pod definition for environment variables with values containing `@azurekeyvault` (see example below). If it does not find any, the Pod starts as normal. If it does find environment variables with values containing `@azurekeyvault`, it mutates (changes) the Pod with:

* A init-container (image: spvest/azure-keyvault-env) with these volumes:
  * A in-memory volume at `/azure-keyvault/`
  * A host volume at `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` (only for default auth)
* Changes the executable for the Pod container (more on that later)

Example where environment variable has value containing `@azurekeyvault`:

```yaml
env:
  - name: MY_AKV_SECRET
    value: some-secret@azurekeyvault
```

As mentioned, the Pod container gets mutated to use a different executable. It does this by changing either the CMD or the ENTRYPOINT, depending on which was used by the original container, to use the `azure-keyvault-env` executable instead. The "old" command gets passed in as parameter to this new executable.

### The Pod starts the init-container

When the Env Injector webhook is finished, Kubernetes will start the Pod with its new changes. This will trigger the following sequence:

1. The init-container will start
2. The init-container copies the `azure-keyvault-env` executable into `/azure-keyvault/`
3. If default authentication is used, the `/etc/kubernetes/azure.json` located on the node, containing Azure AKS default credentials is copied to `/azure-keyvault/`

The volume `/azure-keyvault/` is a shared in-memory volume accessible to both the init-container and the original container. This is how the init-container can "give" the original container access to files.

> Note: All files located in the volume `/azure-keyvault/` will be deleted as soon as the original container starts up. It would be a security issue to have these files available to the container after startup.

</ExpansionPanelListItem>
<ExpansionPanelListItem number="3">

### The Pod starts the original container

When the original container starts it will execute the `azure-keyvault-env` command, which will:

1. Connect to Azure Key Vault, using credentials found in `/azure-keyvault/azure.json` (when default auth is used) - or use custom credentials
2. Download any Azure Key Vault secrets, identified by the environment placeholders
3. Delete all content from the shared volume `/azure-keyvault/`:
    1. Delete itself (`azure-keyvault-env`)
    2. Delete `/azure-keyvault/azure.json` - default credentials
4. Execute the original command and params, pass on the updated environment variables with real secret values

**✨The end result is that all secrets gets injected transparently in-memory during container startup. It will not reveal any secret content in the container spec, disk or logs. The only component that can read the secrets, are the program running inside the container. ✨**
